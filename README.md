# FAQ

## Why this doesn't work just by calling the template like `cookiecutter gh:neowinx/cookiecutter-postgres-go-echo-restful` or something similar?

Well I haven't found and easy way to prompt dinamically for a selection of the desired tables to be generated by using hooks or any
other method described in the advanced usage section of cookiecutter [here](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/index.html)
I happily encorage you to do it and then send a PR if you consider this to be like a life-or-death missing feature or something
